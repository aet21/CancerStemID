# CancerStemID

## An Introduction to the CancerStemID R-package

## Summary

The purpose of the `CancerStemID` R-package is to illustrate the functionality of a number of R-functions for estimating various measures of cancer-risk from a single-cell RNA-Seq dataset that has profiled cells from all major stages of cancer development including normal, preneoplastic and cancer cells. Specifically, it aims to identify the cells at highest risk of neoplastic transformation.

## Installation

To install:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("aet21/CancerStemID")
```
